Project Specification: "Golf Tracker AI"
1. Project Overview

Goal: Build a premium, high-performance golf tracking application.

Core Feature (MVP): Users upload a photo of a physical scorecard. The app uses AI (OCR) to extract hole-by-hole data, populates a verification form, and saves the round to the database.

Secondary Features: Comprehensive statistics dashboard (GIR, Fairway %, Scrambling), calculated dynamically from hole-by-hole data.

Design Philosophy: "Premium & Modern." High-end UI. Avoid standard bootstrap/dashboard looks. Use bento-grids, micro-interactions, and beautiful charts.

2. Tech Stack (Strict Requirements)

Framework: Next.js 15+ (App Router).

Language: TypeScript (Strict mode).

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (for base components) + Aceternity UI or Magic UI (for visual flair/landing page).

Database & Auth: Supabase (PostgreSQL).

Charts: Recharts or Tremor.

AI/OCR: OpenAI API (GPT-4o Vision) or Gemini 1.5 Pro (Vision) via SDK.

3. Database Schema (Supabase)

Table: profiles

id (UUID, PK, references auth.users)

username (text)

handicap_index (decimal)

avatar_url (text)

home_course (text)

Table: rounds

id (UUID, PK)

user_id (UUID, FK -> profiles.id)

date_played (date)

course_name (text)

total_score (int)

scorecard_image_url (text)

Table: holes

id (UUID, PK)

round_id (UUID, FK -> rounds.id)

hole_number (int, 1-18)

par (int)

score (int)

putts (int)

fairway_hit (boolean, nullable)

gir (boolean)

The database schema above was completely generated by Gemini 3.0 Pro, I will go over it at the beginning of my work on this project and edit it if needed

4. User Flow & Roadmap

Phase 1 (Immediate): Project initialization, Supabase connection, Authentication (Sign In/Up), and a "Skeleton" Dashboard using high-end UI components (Bento Grid layout).

Phase 2: Manual Round Entry (Form to input course data + 18 holes grid).

Phase 3: AI Integration (Image upload -> AI processing -> Auto-fill the Phase 2 form).

5. Immediate Agent Task

Initialize the Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind.

Install shadcn/ui and lucide-react.

Set up the Supabase client helper functions.

Generate the SQL migration file for the schema defined above.

Create a modern "Login" page and an empty "Dashboard" page to verify routing is working.
